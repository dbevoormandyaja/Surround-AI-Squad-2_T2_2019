# SURROUND 
##### PROVIDING FRAMEWORK FOR MACHINE LEARNING
What is Surround?

Surround is a lightweight framework for serving machine learning pipelines in Python. It is designed to be flexible, easy to use and to assist data scientists by focusing them on the problem at hand rather than writing glue code. Surround was initiated by [Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://a2i2.deakin.edu.au/?_ga=2.89224082.883259530.1567654397-616601693.1516780416)

# WHY SURROUND?

#### *CODING MADE EASY*  
Surround uses more flexible way in serving machine pipeline using python codes which is very easy when compared to C/C++ codes
#### *SUPPORTS MULTIPLE FRAMEWORK*

 Surround supports multiple models which can be combined from different frameworks and have a single surround solution.
#### *WE CAN USE EXISTING APIâ€™s*
 You can use existing intelligent APIs as part of your Surround implementation.
#### *REUSE DEPENDENCIES*
 Surround dependencies can be combined and saved in case we need that to be used in another machine learning pipelines
